# Decision Tree Algorithm

The decision tree algorithm is a popular machine learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that works by recursively partitioning the input space into regions based on the features of the input data. The resulting tree is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on the value of a specific feature, and each leaf node represents a class label or a regression value.

The decision tree algorithm works by selecting the best feature to split the data at each internal node, based on a criterion that measures the homogeneity of the resulting subsets. The most commonly used criteria are entropy and Gini impurity for classification problems, and mean squared error for regression problems.

Decision trees have several advantages, including their interpretability, their ability to handle both categorical and numerical data, and their ability to handle missing values. However, they can be prone to overfitting if the tree is too deep, and they can be sensitive to the choice of splitting criteria.

If you want to implement the decision tree algorithm in Python, you can use libraries like scikit-learn or pandas. These libraries provide a range of tools for building and evaluating decision tree models. There are also many tutorials and examples available online to help you get started.


This repository contains a Python implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm for classification tasks. The algorithm is based on the ID3 algorithm and uses the entropy criterion for splitting the data.

## Installation
To use the Decision Tree algorithm, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. 
You can install the required packages using

``
pip
``

## Usage
To use the Decision Tree algorithm, you can create an instance of the DecisionTree class and call its fit method to train the model on a dataset. 
Here is an example usage:
```ruby
from decision_tree import DecisionTree
```
## Create an instance of the DecisionTree class
```ruby
tree = DecisionTree()
```
## load data from a CSV file
```ruby
data = load_data("data.csv")
```
## Split the data into training and testing sets
```ruby
train_data, test_data = split_data(data, split_ratio=0.8)
```
## train the model on the training set
```ruby
tree.fit(train_data)
```

## test the model on the testing set
```ruby
accuracy = tree.score(test_data)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```
